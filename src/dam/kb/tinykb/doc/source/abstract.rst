Abstract
========

TinyKB is a Python module for defining and handling object-oriented
*knowledge bases* composed by cross-referencing *classes* and
*objects* stored in a SQL DBMS.  It is also a "dynamic
object-relational mapper" in two senses: the knowledge base elements
are dynamically mapped into autogenerated Python classes and objects,
and the SQL schema is dynamically extended according to class
definitions.  This approach departs from other ORMs, which usually
expect SQL-mapped Python classes to be statically defined in the
source code, and provide little or no support for run-time SQL schema
extension.  TinyKB uses Python dynamic features to provide an
easy-to-use API for querying and handling the knowledge base, while at
the same time ensuring that the underlying SQL schema is normalized,
well-typed and data-centric (thus leveraging the DBMS capabilities for
data consistency and integrity).
