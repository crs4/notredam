Introduction
============

TinyKB is a Python module for implementing and managing *knowledge
bases* composed by *classes* and *objects* (i.e. class instances)
containing both scalar and vectorial *attributes* (and possibly
cross-references).

TinyKB classes are similar to those offered by object-oriented
programming languages: they are defined with a set of strongly-typed
attributes, and they support single inheritance; furthermore, they can
be used to dinamically generate Python classes, which in turn can
instantiate Python objects.  Both classes and objects are
automatically mapped to a SQL data base.

TinyKB tries to leverage the full power of the SQL language and DBMSs,
avoiding the "key/value" approach usually adopted when the data schema
is unknown until run-time (i.e. when dealing with "unstructured"
data).  TinyKB reflects class definitions in the underlying,
autogenerated SQL DB schema:

    * classes and attributes are mapped to dedicated tables and
      columns;

    * class hierarchies and cross-references are implemented with
      referential constraints;

    * object attribute types and constraints are enforced using DBMS
      checks.

This approach brings three advantages:

    #. the SQL representation of the KB is clean, data-centric and
       application-agnostic;

    #. the SQL DBMS becomes an additional safety layer
       ensuring data integrity;

    #. the knowledge base can be explored and queried with the full
       power of SQL, avoiding excessive ``JOIN`` usage.

TinyKB provides a developer-friendly API which hides its SQL
machinery.  Under the hood, Python metaprogramming and other run-time
features are used to dynamically generate modules and classes, thus
offering a transparent mapping to the underlying knowledge base.

TinyKB is integrated (and distributed with) `NotreDAM`_, but it could
be easily readapted into a stand-alone product (NotreDAM-specfic parts
are outlined throughout this documentation).

.. warning:: this is an initial release of the documentation for
             TinyKB |version|.  The package is still evolving, and its
             API may still change in backward-incompatible ways.
